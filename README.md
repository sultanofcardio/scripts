# Useful scripts

A bunch of useful scripts I keep moving around. This is a central place to keep them, and share them with you in case 
you find this sort of thing useful.

## Bash scripts

* [Recursively convert https git URLs to SSH](bash/git-https-to-ssh)
* [Recursively download SSL certificates for a host](bash/gencerts)
* [Print file sizes in human readable format](bash/sizes)
* [Install/upgrade to the latest version of docker and docker-compose](bash/install-docker)
